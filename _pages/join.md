General membership in the militia is open to all lawful citizens of a state, ages 16 and up. There shall be no discrimination due to race, sex, national origin or physical characteristics.

All prospective members shall be required to give their name, date of birth, address,contact information, next of kin and general information detailing prior military experience and/or other such skills as may be utilized by the militia.

## Familiarize yourself with the standards

As a Light Foot battalion, we base our operations on the [Militia Standards and Principles of the Light Foot][standards]. We expect participants to be familiar with these standards, and abide by the guidelines set forth therein. Please download and print a copy. You're not expected to **memorize it**, but at least familiarize yourself with it before attending your first meeting, especially the _Statement of Ethics/Mission Statement_ section on page 1, and the _Duty and Code of Conduct_ on page 3.

## Attend a meeting

We ask potential recruits to attend one of the public monthly meeting before they attend any of our Field Training Excercises (FTX). At the meeting you will have an opportunity to meet others, introduce yourself to the the officers, and ask questions. We meet on the first Tuesday of each month in Meridian, at 7pm. Because the meetings are held on private property, we disclose the location to prospective recruits upon request. Please email **adacounty1stbnlfm** `[at]` **gmail** `[dot com]` for information about our next meeting.

## Prepare

As a new recruit, you are not expected to show up in a "full kit" on day one. Take a deeper look at the [Militia Standards and Principles of the Light Foot][standards] document, and familiarize yourself with the equiptment that you'll need. Resist the urge to max out your AMEX at Cabellas on day one. Pick up gear as you can afford it, and as you learn what works for you and what doesn't. The only **ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE** is an Individual First Aid Kit (IFAK), that someone else can use to treat **YOU** if you're wounded. This is required to be **ON YOUR PERSON** at all times during an FTX. 

## Train

We encourage everyone to train as often as possible. Our monthly FTX is one opportunity, but individuals, and small teams should ideally be training once or twice per week! As you attend meetings and trainings, you'll meet others who live close to you; we encourage you to train together as a small group. [Learn more about Training][training]

## Get involved

Beyond the basic requirements of an enlisted militiamen, we there are many ways to contribute. These opportunities range from teaching a class or conducting a training, helping to recruit at local meetings, and assisting during events. If you have something to contribute,  speak up.
